Paper Texture Image
====================

This file should contain a subtle paper texture image for the background.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Dimensions: 1000x1000px or larger
- Style: Off-white/ivory subtle paper texture
- File size: Keep under 100KB if possible

You can:
1. Use a free stock photo from sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
   Search for: "white paper texture", "ivory paper", "vintage paper"

2. Create your own using image editing software

3. Use a solid color temporarily and add texture later

If you don't have a texture image, you can temporarily comment out
the background-image line in styles.css (line ~91) and the page will
use the solid background color instead.
